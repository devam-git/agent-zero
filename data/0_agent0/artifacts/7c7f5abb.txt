The Bengal tiger, once abundant in the Indian subcontinent, is now facing the threat of extinction due to various factors. Habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict are the primary reasons for their declining numbers. Conservation efforts are underway, but challenges remain in ensuring the survival of this majestic species. The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the last strongholds for the Bengal tiger, but even here, the population is dwindling. Efforts to combat poaching, protect habitats, and promote sustainable development are crucial to prevent the extinction of tigers in Bengal.
